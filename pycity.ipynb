    "First, we should note before making any conclusive observations about the data that, as previously stated, this data was not cleaned for anomalies or outliers. Therefore, the data may be flawed and deviate from any patterns we note in the following written analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that we can observe from the data is smaller schools tend to perform better. The schools with the largest student populations have a significantly lower percentage of students passing in both math and reading, whereas the small and medium sized schools both have approximately 90% of their students passing both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thin we can observe from the data is that charter schools perform better than the district schools, and although this assignment did not ask for the average budget difference between charter and district schools, it appears that charter schools actually have a lesser budget. \n",
    "\n",
    "A third observation from the data is that budget does not seem to have a positive correlation with performance. Schools with a larger budget did not perform better than schools with a smaller budget on average. This third observation in conjunction with the first two might lead further research to explore if it is a causal relationship between the smaller student population and performance and if that may help explain the success of charter schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately purely based on these data we are unable to make any conclusions on causation of these trends. But this analysis would recommend future research on the mechanisms by which we see a positive relationship between size and performance over budget spend and performance, particularly in relations to charter versus district schools.
